#THERMO-BAROMETER
##Description:
This project is a combination of hardware and software to create a system that utilizes an HP3O3B sensor, an ESP8266 microcontroller, a Tripler base adapter, and a 0.66-inch OLED display to measure and display environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The system is designed to be compact, easy to assemble, and suitable for various IoT applications.

##Hardware Components:
HP3O3B sensor: A high-precision environmental sensor that measures temperature, humidity, and air pressure.
ESP8266 microcontroller: A widely used Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller that provides the processing power and connectivity for the project.
Tripler base adapter: A custom-made PCB that serves as a connector between the HP3O3B sensor and the ESP8266 microcontroller, allowing for easy integration.
0.66-inch OLED display: A small display that shows the measured environmental data in a user-friendly format.
Software:
The software for this project involves programming the ESP8266 microcontroller to read data from the HP3O3B sensor and display it on the 0.66-inch OLED display. The software can be written in a programming language such as C++ or Arduino programming language, and can utilize libraries or frameworks specifically designed for working with the ESP8266 and the HP3O3B sensor.

##Installation:
To set up the project, follow these steps:

- Assemble the hardware components according to the provided instructions for the Tripler base adapter.
- Connect the HP3O3B sensor to the Tripler base adapter as per the pinout diagram.
- Connect the Tripler base adapter to the ESP8266 microcontroller.
- Connect the 0.66-inch OLED display to the ESP8266 microcontroller.
- Upload the software code to the ESP8266 microcontroller using a suitable programming environment or IDE.
- Power up the system and verify that the environmental data is being displayed correctly on the OLED display.

##Usage:
The HP3O3B ESP8266 Tripler Base Adapter with 0.66" OLED Display can be used in various IoT applications where environmental data monitoring is required. For example, it can be used in weather stations, smart home systems, or industrial monitoring systems. The system can be customized and extended to suit specific requirements by modifying the software code or adding additional hardware components.
